## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- f5c066b: Security hardening, P2: QR codes, ID chips, the screen.
  
  - **QR codes** are versioned (`HUMID:2:KIND:CODE:EXPIRY`), say what they're for and
    when they expire, and must be exactly that: no bare codes, old formats, URLs or
    extra fields from the camera, and a scanner only takes the kind it asked for.
    Older apps' QR codes aren't scanned; type the code instead.
  - **The device showing a code checks it too**: a server that answers with a code
    for keys of its own is caught before anything is shown (adding a device, asking
    for recovery help, offering to be a witness).
  - **Adding a device** ends with an account check on both screens: the new device
    joins only once the person confirms they match. The new device's name for itself
    is shown as its own claim, without control or direction-changing characters.
  - **ID chips**: every length and tag from a chip is bounds-checked; a chip can't
    chain answers forever or send malformed secure-messaging fields; session keys
    and the keys derived from the MRZ are wiped after reading.
  - **Passive authentication** (server) now requires the content-type attribute,
    verifies with the certificate the SOD names, requires a document-signing
    certificate, and requires one country throughout: the CSCA's, the document
    signer's, and the issuer in the MRZ. Every data group sent is checked, and the
    MRZ's overall and personal-number check digits too.
  - **Stations**: a chip that can prove it's present (it has an Active Authentication
    key) must answer a fresh challenge at the station too. Stations read chips; they
    no longer load chip files.
  - **The screen** (Android): no screenshots, recording or recents thumbnail; other
    apps can't draw over HumID; taps through an overlay are ignored. No hand-off to
    camera apps. (iPhone, with the next signed build: a cover in the app switcher and
    while the screen is recorded or mirrored; third-party keyboards refused.)
  - **No clipboard**: the seal card and ID numbers can't be copied. Keyboard
    suggestions and learning are off in every field.
  - **Server logs** record each request's route, never the codes or ids in its path.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 1f7c706: Android: "biometric key is gone" no longer leaves you stuck.
  
  - Android never backs up or transfers HumID's data (`allowBackup="false"` and data
    extraction rules for Android 12+). The Keystore keys that unlock a HumID can't
    leave the phone, so a restored copy, after a reinstall or on a new phone, was a
    HumID nothing could open. A reinstall now starts cleanly at Welcome.
  - When the phone has deleted the key anyway (its fingerprints or face changed), the
    app says so on its own screen, with "Set HumID up again", instead of failing
    every unlock with the same message. The gate reports it as `key_invalidated`.
  - The Android gate notices an invalidated key before showing the fingerprint prompt.

## 2.0.0

- Gate contract v2: every check signs a challenge with the device's hardware liveness key (`live`), and can attest a fresh key to the session (`attest`).
- Removed the WebAuthn passkey gate: passkeys can fall back to a device PIN or password.
- Demo gate only in builds made with HUMID_ALLOW_DEMO=1.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release, split out of the single-file HumID Vault. Biometric interrupt gates: native OS key stores, WebAuthn PRF, demo.
