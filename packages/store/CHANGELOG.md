# @humid/store

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- b6e32b8: Offline mode, read only. With no connection (or the vault server down), Unlock still
  works: the same live face or fingerprint check opens a copy kept on the device of the
  document list, Activity and Security as of the last time it was online. Documents
  themselves never open offline: the document and its key stay in the vault, so split
  keys and the per-hour cap protect exactly as before. The copy is sealed under a key
  derived from the account seed (@humid/crypto `offlineKey`, `sealOffline`,
  `openOffline`), isn't written during a duress session, and is erased with the device's
  vault or when the server says the device was removed. The duress gesture works offline
  and shows only the decoy documents. "Reconnect" signs back in with one live check.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5910975: Anonymous payment for registration. New `@humid/pass` module (1.0.0) (RFC 9474 blind
  signatures, RSABSSA-SHA384-PSS-Randomized, and access codes) and a new `access`
  service (1.0.0) that sells nothing it can link to an account: access codes are swapped
  for blind-signed passes, and registration spends a pass. The gateway requires a
  pass to create a HumID unless `HUMID_REGISTRATION=open`. The app gains an access
  step in onboarding, keeps unspent passes in a new `wallet` store (IndexedDB v2)
  so a paid code survives a crash, and the HTP client reads the new
  `registration` / `passBuyUrl` policy hints. See docs/ANONYMITY.md.

## 1.2.0

- Identity schema 4: the record names its device and holds account seed ‖ device seed; `pending` tracks a device that is still joining an account.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release, split out of the single-file HumID Vault. Identity and vault persistence with per-record schema migrations.
